## Technologies

This project is built with:

- **Frontend**: Vite, TypeScript, React, shadcn-ui, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Edge Functions)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth
- **Storage**: Supabase Storage
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages, Vercel
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ & npm installed - [install with nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)
- Supabase account (for backend features)

### Local Development

```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Navigate to the project directory
cd jobbyist-beta

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

### Environment Variables

For local development, create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`:

```sh
cp .env.example .env
# Then edit .env with your actual credentials
```

Required variables for development:
```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_publishable_key
VITE_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
VITE_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=your_paypal_client_id
VITE_PAYPAL_MONTHLY_PLAN_ID=your_monthly_plan_id
VITE_PAYPAL_YEARLY_PLAN_ID=your_yearly_plan_id
```

⚠️ **Important**: Never commit the `.env` file. It's already in `.gitignore`.

For production deployment, all secrets must be configured in **GitHub Secrets**. See [SECRETS_SETUP_GUIDE.md](SECRETS_SETUP_GUIDE.md) for detailed instructions.

## Backend Configuration

### 🚀 Quick Start

**New to backend setup?** Start here: **[QUICK_START_BACKEND.md](QUICK_START_BACKEND.md)** - 5-step guide (~15 minutes)

- ✅ Supabase Edge Functions (job-scraper, job-cleanup, seed-jobs)
- ✅ Database Migrations (automatic deployment)
- ✅ PayPal Payment Integration (Pro subscriptions)
- ✅ Optional: AI Chatbot, Error Tracking, Analytics

**Detailed Setup Guides**:

## GitHub Actions Workflows

### Automatic Deployments

- **Deploy to GitHub Pages**: Automatically deploys on push to `main` branch
  - Uses Node.js 20 with npm caching for faster builds
  - Includes all required environment variables for production builds
  - Separate from CI/CD to ensure clean deployments
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Runs tests, linting, and type checking on PRs
  - Validates code quality before merging
  - Runs security scans with npm audit and Snyk

### Supabase Deployment

- **Deploy Supabase**: Deploys migrations and edge functions
  ```bash
  # Triggered automatically when supabase/ folder changes
  # or run manually from Actions tab
  ```

### Job Seeding

- **Seed Job Listings**: Seeds 50 jobs (25 South African + 25 Nigerian)
  ```bash
  # Run manually from Actions tab
  # Input confirmation: "seed-jobs"
  ```

## Supabase Edge Functions

The platform includes three edge functions:

1. **job-scraper**: Scrapes and imports job listings from partner sites
2. **job-cleanup**: Removes old job listings and maintains database health
3. **seed-jobs**: Seeds initial job listings for testing and demo purposes

## Deployment

### GitHub Pages

The application is deployed as a Single Page Application (SPA) to GitHub Pages on every push to `main`:

```sh
npm run build
# Builds to dist/ folder with:
# - SPA routing support (404.html fallback)
# - Custom domain configuration (CNAME)
# - Jekyll processing disabled (.nojekyll)
# Automatically deployed via GitHub Actions
```

**Deployment Features:**
- ✅ Single Page Application (not a static website)

### Vercel (Alternative Deployment)

The application can also be deployed to Vercel with full Supabase integration:

vercel --prod

# Or import from GitHub at https://vercel.com
```

**Vercel Configuration:**
- ✅ Automatic builds from GitHub
- ✅ Environment variables configured in `vercel.json`
- ✅ Supabase connection pre-configured
- ✅ Edge Network for optimal performance
- ✅ Preview deployments for all PRs

For detailed Vercel setup instructions, see **[VERCEL_SETUP.md](VERCEL_SETUP.md)**.

### Custom Domain

1. CNAME file is automatically included in the build
2. DNS records should point to GitHub Pages
3. HTTPS is automatically configured by GitHub Pages
